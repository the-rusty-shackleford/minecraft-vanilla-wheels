"""Press or let go of one key on the booth's display through XTEST, as a person would.

Why: NeoForge reads Shift, Control and Alt from GLFW's own key state, which only a real key
event changes. A press handed straight to Minecraft's key handler leaves that state alone, so
the booth's check that the horn works under Left Control would pass on the code that broke it.

Usage: DISPLAY=:7 uv run --no-project --with python-xlib python xkey.py down|up KEYSYM

Effects: sends one fake press (down) or release (up) of KEYSYM, an X keysym name such as
Shift_L, space or g, and exits 0. Exits 2 without sending on a display that has a window
manager: that is a desktop someone is using, and the booth's Xephyr has none. Exits 1 on a
keysym the display has no key for.
