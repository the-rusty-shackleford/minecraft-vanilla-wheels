 * sampled at points no more than {@link #SPACING} apart over its whole volume -- every corner among
 * them -- so no full block can stand inside a box without holding a point. A long, thin body is
 * several boxes (a cabin, a boom, a fin), where two points at the ends of one long box would miss
 * the boom's whole middle. Rotorcraft built this for its aircraft (its D-0001); it moved here when
